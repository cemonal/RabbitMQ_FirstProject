# RabbitMQ_FirstProject

Welcome to the RabbitMQ_FirstProject! This project provides a simple example of using RabbitMQ messaging in a .NET Core 3.1 application. RabbitMQ is a widely used message broker that allows you to send and receive messages between different parts of your application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- [.NET Core 3.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)
- [RabbitMQ Server](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

### Usage

1. Launch your RabbitMQ Server and make sure it's up and running.
2. Open the `Program.cs` file in the `RabbitMQ_FirstProject` project.
